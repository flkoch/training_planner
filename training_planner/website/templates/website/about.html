<h2>{% trans "Privacy Policy" %}</h2>
<p class="text-justify">{% trans "This website is used to showcase the training offering and facilitate registration for the individual training sessions. For registering for a certain training session as well as for seeing the details related to any training session, the user must create an account. Related to that account we save the following data: first and last name, date of birth, e-mail address, password and a relation to all trainings the user has taken part in, either as instructor, participant or coordinator." %}</p>
<p class="text-justify">{% trans "By creating an account and the continued use, the respective user agrees to the processing of his or her data in agreement with this privacy policy. An account can be deleted at any time by sending a request clearly stating the intend to have the account deleted to <a href='mailto:info@jcu.ch'>info@jcu.ch</a>. Afterwards the account will be suspended and the data be deleted after eight weeks." %}</p>
<p class="text-justify">{% trans "The names of trainers and coordinators for trainings are displayed publicly. Only users with an account can see further details, such as other participants registered for the training. However, regular users only get to see the first name and the initials of the other participants last names. Trainer names are always shown in full. Only trainers and other staff have access to see the remaining user details. Passwords are never saved in clear text but only in hashed form." %}</p>
<p class="text-justify">{% trans "The date of birth can be looked up by trainers to check if the registered attendees actually fit the training session. The e-mail adresses can be used by trainers and staff to send messages through the platform directly. Furthermore, users can reset their password by clicking on the respective link once they failed to log in. In case there are several accounts using the same e-mail address, like in the case of a mother creating accounts for her children, the automatic password reset fails. In such a case please contact us at <a href='mailto:info@jcu.ch'>info@jcu.ch</a>." %}</p>
<p class="text-justify">{% trans "Apart from the user supplied data, each request to the server is recorded in so called log-files. These contain information on the requested site, the time of the request, the address (ip address) the request came from, the user agent and possibly further request parameters. These logs are used for occasionally checking the function of the it infrastructure." %}</p>
<p class="text-justify">{% trans "None of the collected data is monetised or shared with third parties, except where this is required by law, as in the case of a positive COVID-19 test result and the subsequent investigations for people having had contact with that person. All the data resides on servers within Switzerland or the European Union. Thus it either falls under the Swiss Privacy Act or the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The servers are protected against unautorised access according to the current technical standard. Access to the site is done through TLS encrypted connections, as can be verified by the lock icon near the address bar in most modern browsers. However, the usual risks of using electronic communication and online storage of data remain." %}</p>
<h2>{% trans "How to use this platform" %}</h2>
<p class="text-justify">{% trans "Everyone can open an account by supplying the required information. The user is required to enter genuine information or leave the fields empty if allowed. As the tool is used to comply with current legal requirements of attandence records, we reserve the right to cancel any accounts which do not comply with these terms of use." %}</p>
<p class="text-justify">{% trans "Every user with a user account can register for training sessions in the respective registration period. If the user opens the detail view of any training outside the registration period, a notice is shown displaying the opening of the registration if the registration has not yet been opened or the closing date in case the registration is already closed. Furthermore, there is a limited number of available spots per training. If there is no more free spots, users cannot register for the respective training session. Thus it is only fair to cancel the registration if you cannot attend the training, to allow others to take that spot." %}</p>
<p class="text-justify">{% trans "In addition users can register as coordinators. Coordinators have to controll the entrance and make sure everyone complies with the current rules. If someone does not comply, the coordinator may not grant access to that person. Parents taking the role as coordinators do not have to register individually but can simply register as coordinator via the accout of their child. They are however free to create their own account." %}</p>
<p class="text-justify">{% trans "On their account page users can see all the data they have entered and the trainings they have registered for and those they attended. Also they are able to change their account details if that should be neccessary." %}</p>
<h2>{% trans "Training Planner" %}</h2>
<p class="text-justify">{% trans "The training planner is an open-source <a href='https://www.djangoproject.com/' target='_blank'>Django</a> web app, which was developped by <a href='mailto:flkoch@dev.fkoch.ch'>Florian Koch (flkoch@dev.fkoch.ch)</a> to allow for training registration and attandence records. It is accessible from <a href='https://github.com/flkoch/training_planner' target='_blank'>GitHub</a>." %}
